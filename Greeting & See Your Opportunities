Hi everyone!
I’m Sevana Chan.
If you and your friends or your children are busy with the TOEFL test, I strongly recommend you to listen to me.
So who am I and why should you do that?
I graduated from Peking University, the top 1 in mainland China, as a Master of Translation and Interpretation. I’ve always wanted to do something to give it back to society, so after graduation, I worked for New Oriental, the top education and technology company here.
I was grateful to have met so many promising young talents and their parents when I was supervising on their long journey preparing to pursue a further education overseas. Unfortunately, I soon realized that how many of them had wasted excessively much of their time and energy into this standard language test called TOEFL by not being themselves, and ended up feeling exhausted, simply because nobody has ever told them and showed them the way that they could have enjoyed the whole learning process, found out their own way and performed well in a test like TOEFL.
So that’s why I’m here to help you, or your friends, or your children who should be given a chance sooner, with my expertise, my own experience and hundreds of successful students and their parents.
Before you’re leaving, there’s one more step for you to get closer to the never-seen TOEFL learning experience and **THE ONE STRATEGY ONLY FOR YOU**. If you want to own such amazing learning experience, **make sure you follow my channel** to keep yourself updated with effective learning tools and strategies. 
Remember, I have created my own unique TOEFL learning experience, and helped many of my students and their parents to find out their own way of creating, learning, and having fun! And I don’t want you to miss it anymore!!!
